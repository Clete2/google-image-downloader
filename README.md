# Overview
Downloads 5 images from Google for each line in a text file.

# Running
1. Create `image.txt` in the current folder
1. Add each query to its own line
1. `yarn && yarn start` (or run the binary)

After a delay, you will see an `output` folder has been created and your images should start appearing.
